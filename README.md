### Overview:
This work in progress project features microscopy data of Symbiodiniaceae cells, gathered from a so-called mother machine. The mother machine originally developed by Wang et al. in 2010, is a microfluidic instrument able to, in a high-throughput manner, track individual cell lineages over multiple generations. The mother machine has a series of horizontal growth traps connected to a main trench where a flow of growth media is transported to the growth channels to ensure proper regulation of cell growth. 

The project aims to create a semi-autmoatic pipeline in Python to crop the growth channels, segment and track the Symbiodiniaceae cells, and extract features such as growth rate, texture features, etc. 
The Pipeline will enable future research to analyse these cells in

### The pipeline is in the jupyter notebook named MM_pipeline on the master branch
