### Overview:
This work in progress project features microscopy data of Symbiodiniaceae cells, gathered from a so-called mother machine. The mother machine, originally developed by Wang et al. in 2010, is a microfluidic instrument able to, in a high-throughput manner, track individual cell lineages over multiple generations. The mother machine has a series of horizontal growth traps connected to a main trench where a flow of growth media is transported to the growth channels to ensure proper regulation of cell growth.

The project aims to create a semi-automatic pipeline in Python to crop the growth channels, segment and track the Symbiodiniaceae cells, and extract features such as growth rate, texture features, etc. The pipeline will serve as a tool and enable future research to analyze these cells in various environmental conditions.
