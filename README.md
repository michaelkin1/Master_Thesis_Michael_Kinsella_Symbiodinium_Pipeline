# Developing an Image Analysis Pipeline for Insights into Symbiodiniaceae Growth and Morphology 

### Project Overview 
Welcome to the repository for the master's degree project on Symbiodiniaceae cell microscopy data, conducted using a custom-built mother machine device. Originally developed by Wang et al. in 2010, the mother machine is a microfluidic instrument designed for high-throughput tracking of individual cell lineages across multiple generations. It features a series of horizontal growth traps connected to a main trench, where a continuous flow of growth media regulates cell growth in controlled conditions.

#### Overview of the Pipeline

### Project Goals
This project establishes the foundational framework for a JupyterLab pipeline dedicated to segmenting population-wide growth and morphological features of Symbiodiniaceae cells. As development progresses, this pipeline will evolve into a robust tool enabling future researchers to analyze Symbiodiniaceae cells under diverse environmental conditions.


### Thesis Paper
For a comprehensive understanding of this project, please refer to the master's thesis document:
