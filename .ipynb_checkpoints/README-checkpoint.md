To analyze your data 
1. First convert your file to a TIFF-file. This can be done with bfconvert in the terminal/command prompt. Check https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/downloads/ for download to be able to use the bfconvert command. 
   After downloading the "Bio-Format Package" write the following code in your terminal/command prompt: bfconvert <path/to/your/old_file.xyz> <path/to/new_file.tiff>
2. Open the ipynb in python and replace the initial file path with your .tiff file path and run the script.
